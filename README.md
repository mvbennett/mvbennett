### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Mike.

Iâ€™m a developer mainly focused on web apps across the stack using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Currently involved in supporting small-sized organizations such as Acme Hall Studios and CBID. 

Iâ€™ve infused my design work and photography into the web apps Iâ€™ve developed - I am always seeking to add personality to what I create or collaborate on. 

As my next step Iâ€™m looking to be part of a small team either at a startup or medium-sized business.

Check out some of my work here: https://mvbennett.me

Iâ€™m also a huge coffee nerd and always down to meet and talk about web development, software engineering, or coffee culture. Feel free to message me!
